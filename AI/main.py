                        MAIN.PY - FastAPI Server Entry Point
===================================================================================

📚 WHAT IS THIS FILE?
--------------------
This is the MAIN ENTRY POINT of our AI Service. It creates and runs the FastAPI 
server that our Node.js Backend calls.

🔗 HOW IT CONNECTS WITH BACKEND & FRONTEND:
-------------------------------------------
    Frontend (React) 
         ↓ 
    Backend (Node.js/Express - port 8080)
         ↓ 
    AI Service (FastAPI/Python - port 8000)  ← This file runs this!
         ↓
    Qdrant Vector DB (port 6333)

📖 WHAT IS FastAPI?
------------------
FastAPI is a modern Python web framework for building APIs.
- It's FAST (as the name suggests)
- It automatically generates API documentation at /docs
- It validates request data automatically using Pydantic
- It's async-friendly (can handle many requests at once)

Think of it like Express.js but for Python, and with extra superpowers!

📌 COMPARISON WITH YOUR NOTES:
-----------------------------
In your notes (advanced_rag/main.py), you wrote:
    uvicorn.run(app, port=8000, host="0.0.0.0")
    
This is the SAME pattern! We use uvicorn to run our FastAPI server.

#                           IMPORTS SECTION
# =============================================================================

# ----- Standard Library Imports -----
# These come from Python itself, no pip install needed
import os  # For reading environment variables (like API keys)

# ----- Third-Party Library Imports -----
# These need to be installed via pip (see requirements.txt)

from dotenv import load_dotenv
"""
📖 What is load_dotenv?
-----------------------
From the 'python-dotenv' library (pip install python-dotenv)

✔ What it does:
  - Reads your .env file and loads all variables into the system environment
  - After this, you can access them using os.getenv("VARIABLE_NAME")

✔ Why needed?
  - API keys should NEVER be hardcoded in your code (security risk!)
  - Instead, we store them in a .env file which is NOT committed to git
  
Example .env file:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
    QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333

from fastapi import FastAPI
"""
📖 What is FastAPI?
-------------------
From the 'fastapi' library (pip install fastapi)

✔ FastAPI is a class that creates our web application
✔ We create an instance: app = FastAPI()
✔ Then we add routes to this app using decorators like @app.get("/")

import uvicorn
"""
📖 What is uvicorn?
-------------------
From the 'uvicorn' library (pip install uvicorn)

✔ Uvicorn is the SERVER that actually runs your FastAPI code
✔ FastAPI is just code - uvicorn serves it to the internet
✔ Think of it like:
    - FastAPI = The recipe (instructions)
    - Uvicorn = The chef (executes the recipe and serves food)

✔ Why uvicorn specifically?
  - It's an ASGI server (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
  - Perfect for async Python web apps
  - Very fast and efficient

#                     LOAD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# =============================================================================

# 📌 IMPORTANT: Call load_dotenv() BEFORE importing other modules
# Why? Because other modules (like rag_service) need environment variables
# like OPENAI_API_KEY to work. If we import them first, they might fail!

load_dotenv()
"""
✔ This line reads the .env file in the same directory
✔ Now os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") will return your actual API key

📖 What is rag_service?
-----------------------
Our RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) service.

  - PDF upload and indexing
  - Similarity search in vector database
  - Generating answers based on PDF content

📖 What is agent_service?
-------------------------
Our AI Agent service with tools.

📖 What are Routers?
--------------------
Routers are like "sub-applications" that handle related endpoints.

Instead of putting ALL endpoints in one file, we split them:
  - rag_service.py → handles /rag/* endpoints
  - agent_service.py → handles /agent/* endpoints  
  - tools_service.py → handles /stt/*, /ocr/*, /search/* endpoints

Why split?
  - Better organization
  - Easier to understand and maintain
  - Each file focuses on one thing (Single Responsibility Principle)

    This function starts the FastAPI server using uvicorn.

    📖 What is if __name__ == "__main__"?
    -------------------------------------
    This is a Python idiom (common pattern).
    
    ✔ __name__ is a special variable Python sets automatically
    ✔ When you run this file directly (python main.py), __name__ = "__main__"
    ✔ When this file is imported by another file, __name__ = "main"
    
    So this code only runs when you execute: python main.py
    It does NOT run when another file imports from this file.
    
    📌 Why use this pattern?
    - Makes the file both runnable AND importable
    - Prevents the server from starting when you just want to import something
    """
    main()


"""
===================================================================================
                        HOW TO RUN THIS SERVER
===================================================================================

Method 1: Direct Python execution
---------------------------------
    cd /Users/ankursura/Desktop/Projects/Project 3/Sigma GPT/AI
    python main.py

Method 2: Using uvicorn directly (for development with auto-reload)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
    cd /Users/ankursura/Desktop/Projects/Project 3/Sigma GPT/AI
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    
    📌 --reload means: Auto-restart when code changes (great for development!)

===================================================================================
                        HOW THIS CONNECTS TO YOUR BACKEND
===================================================================================

Your Node.js Backend (Backend/routes/chat.js) calls this service:

    const AI_SERVICE_URL = process.env.AI_SERVICE_URL || "http://localhost:8000";
    
    const response = await fetch(`${AI_SERVICE_URL}/rag/query`, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({ question })
    });

So when your Backend wants to:
1. Ask a question about a PDF → calls /rag/query
2. Do a web search → calls /agent/web-search
3. Transcribe audio → calls /stt/transcribe

All these are handled by this FastAPI server!
