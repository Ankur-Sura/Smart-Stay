                    🧳 SMART AI TRAVEL PLANNER - LangGraph Workflow
===================================================================================

📚 WHAT IS THIS FILE?
---------------------
This file implements a COMPREHENSIVE Travel Planner using LangGraph.
It creates personalized travel packages with ALL the features you requested!

🔗 THIS IS SIMILAR TO YOUR stock_graph.py!
Both use:
    - LangGraph StateGraph
    - Multiple nodes connected in sequence
    - State passed between nodes
    - Web search tools for real-time data

📌 WORKFLOW OVERVIEW (8 NODES):
------------------------------
    START
      ↓
    Node 1: DESTINATION RESEARCHER    → Places, weather, safety
      ↓
    Node 2: TRANSPORT FINDER          → Flights, trains, buses, car routes
      ↓
    Node 3: ACCOMMODATION FINDER      → Hotels (central, secure)
      ↓
    Node 4: ACTIVITIES PLANNER        → Sports, adventure, attractions
      ↓
    Node 5: FOOD & SHOPPING GUIDE     → Restaurants, markets
      ↓
    Node 6: TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS       → Visa, SIM, currency, vaccination
      ↓
    Node 7: EMERGENCY & SAFETY        → Hospitals, police, warnings
      ↓
    Node 8: PACKAGE BUILDER           → Creates 2 packages
      ↓
    END

📌 FOR YOUR INTERVIEW:
---------------------
"I built a Travel Planner using LangGraph with 8 specialized nodes.
Each node has a specific responsibility - destination research, transport,
hotels, activities, food, requirements, emergency info, and final package
building. This follows the same pattern as my Stock Research feature but
with more nodes for comprehensive travel planning."

- Tavily Web Search (for real-time data)
- Python TypedDict (for state management)

📌 THE 8 NODES:
--------------
1. DESTINATION RESEARCHER  → Places, weather, safety, customs
2. TRANSPORT FINDER        → Flights, trains, buses, car routes, EV charging
3. ACCOMMODATION FINDER    → Hotels (central, secure, good reviews)
4. ACTIVITIES PLANNER      → Sports, adventure, attractions, entry fees
5. FOOD & SHOPPING GUIDE   → Restaurants (veg/non-veg), markets
6. TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS     → Visa, SIM, currency, vaccination
7. EMERGENCY & SAFETY      → Hospitals, police, embassy, scam warnings
8. PACKAGE BUILDER         → Creates 2 packages (MakeMyTrip + Yatra)

📌 HUMAN-IN-LOOP FEATURES:
-------------------------
The system asks:
- Vehicle preference: EV / Petrol / Diesel
- Food preference: Veg / Non-veg
- Smoker: Yes / No
- Budget: Budget / Mid-range / Luxury
- Adventure interested: Yes / No
- Travel mode: Flight / Train / Bus / Car

📌 OUTPUT - 2 PACKAGES:
----------------------
1. Website Package 1 (MakeMyTrip)  → Pre-made bundle
2. Website Package 2 (Yatra)       → Alternative option

📌 HOW IT WORKS (FLOW):
----------------------
User Query → Extract Source/Destination → Run 8 Nodes in Sequence → 
Each Node Searches Web + Uses LLM → Package Builder Combines All → 
Output 2 Packages

📌 CODE PATTERN (same as Stock Research):
----------------------------------------
```python
# Define State
class TravelPlannerState(TypedDict):
    query: str
    destination_info: str
    # ... more fields

# Define Nodes
def destination_researcher_node(state):
    # Search + LLM summarize
    return {**state, "destination_info": info}

# Build Graph
graph_builder = StateGraph(TravelPlannerState)
graph_builder.add_node("destination_researcher", destination_researcher_node)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "destination_researcher")
# ... more nodes and edges
graph = graph_builder.compile()

# Run
result = graph.invoke(initial_state)
```

📌 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:
--------------------------------

Q: "Why 8 nodes instead of one big function?"
A: "Separation of concerns. Each node has a single responsibility, making the 
   code maintainable and debuggable. If hotel search fails, I know exactly 
   where to look."

Q: "How does state flow between nodes?"
A: "LangGraph passes the state dict to each node. Each node reads what it needs,
   adds its findings, and passes it to the next node. Like a relay race."

Q: "Why use web search instead of APIs?"
A: "Flexibility. Web search (Tavily) can find current prices from any travel
   site without needing individual API integrations. Real travel APIs often
   require partnerships and fees."

Q: "How do you handle user preferences?"
A: "Human-in-Loop pattern. Before running the graph, I collect preferences
   (vehicle type, food, budget) and include them in the initial state.
   Each node respects these preferences when searching and summarizing."

Q: "What if a node fails?"
A: "Each node has try-catch. If it fails, it writes an error to state and
   continues. The Package Builder still creates packages with available info
   and notes what couldn't be found."
