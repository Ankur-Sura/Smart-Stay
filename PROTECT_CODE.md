# 🔒 How to Protect Your Code on GitHub

## Option 1: Make Repository Private (RECOMMENDED)

This is the **best way** to prevent others from seeing or copying your code.

### Steps:

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Ankur-Sura/Smart-Stay

2. **Click on "Settings" tab** (top right of repository page)

3. **Scroll down to "Danger Zone"** (at the bottom)

4. **Click "Change repository visibility"**

5. **Select "Private"** and confirm

6. **Done!** Now only you (and people you explicitly invite) can see the code.

## Option 2: Disable Forking

Even if private, you can prevent forking:

1. **Go to Settings** → **General**

2. **Scroll to "Features" section**

3. **Uncheck "Allow forking"**

---

## Option 3: Change License to Restrictive

Your current LICENSE is MIT (allows everything). You can change it to be more restrictive.

**Note:** If repo is **public**, people can still view/download code even with restrictive license. Making it **private** is the only real protection.

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Public Repository Limitations:
- ❌ **Cannot fully prevent copying** - People can still:
  - View code on GitHub
  - Download as ZIP
  - Clone the repository
  - Copy code manually

### Private Repository Benefits:
- ✅ Only you (and invited collaborators) can see it
- ✅ Can disable forking
- ✅ Full control over who accesses it

## 🎯 Recommended Action:

**Make your repository PRIVATE** - This is the only way to truly protect your code from being copied.
