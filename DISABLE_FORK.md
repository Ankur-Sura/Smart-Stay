# 🚫 How to Disable Forking - Important Information

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATION:

**GitHub does NOT allow disabling forking on PUBLIC repositories.**

The "Allow forking" setting is **ONLY available for PRIVATE repositories**.

---

## Your Options:

### Option 1: Make Repository Private (ONLY way to disable forking)

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Ankur-Sura/Smart-Stay/settings
2. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"** (bottom)
3. Click **"Change repository visibility"**
4. Select **"Private"**
5. Confirm by typing repository name

**Then:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Scroll to **"Features"** section
3. **Uncheck "Allow forking"**
4. Click **"Save"**

**Result:** 
- ✅ Repository is private (only you can see)
- ✅ Forking is disabled
- ✅ Maximum protection

---

### Option 2: Keep Public (Cannot disable forking)

If you keep it **public**, you **CANNOT** disable forking. People will be able to:
- ✅ Fork your repository
- ✅ Clone your repository
- ✅ Download as ZIP
- ✅ View all code

**What you CAN do:**
- Use restrictive license (already done ✅)
- Add copyright notices
- Add terms in README

**But:** These don't prevent forking/cloning, only make it legally clearer.

---

## 🎯 Recommendation:

**To disable forking, you MUST make the repository PRIVATE.**

There is no way to:
- Keep repository PUBLIC
- AND disable forking

These two options are mutually exclusive on GitHub.

---

## 📝 Quick Decision:

**Want to disable forking?** → Make it **PRIVATE**

**Want to keep it public?** → Forking will always be enabled

---

## 🔒 Best Protection Strategy:

1. **Make repository PRIVATE** (only way to disable forking)
2. **Disable forking** in settings (after making private)
3. **Use restrictive license** (already done ✅)
4. **Control collaborator access** carefully

---

**Bottom Line:** If you want to prevent forking, the repository must be private. GitHub does not allow disabling forks on public repositories.
